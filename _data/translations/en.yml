  introduction: "<p>There are two variations of senseBox <br>
      <em>senseBox:home</em> and <em>senseBox:edu</em>.</p>

      <p><em>senseBox:home</em> contains less devices, therefore it is easier to build manually and set up in your home,  in order to measure unique environmental phenomena. It can also be connected to your WiFi or LAN port. The user obtains the individual source code after their registration to <em>openSenseMap</em>. Following registration, users can view continuous, location based measurements collected from sensors, such as temperature, humidity, air pressure, brightness, UV-light and noise on the openSenseMap.</p>

      <p>The <em>senseBox:edu</em> was specifically developed to be applied in school classrooms or by junior scientists at home. The project focus is on learning the basics of programming and electronics, and is related to the collection of environmental data.</p>

      <p>The senseBox setup of components is open under the <a href=\"http://www.ohwr.org/attachments/2388/cern_ohl_v_1_2.txt\" class=\"link\" target=\"_blank\">CERN Open Hardware License 1.2</a>.

    description: "<p>senseBox:edu offers schools, starting from the 7th grade, the possibility to learn programming in a fun and playful environment, to be a real citizen scientist and to get to know the world of geoinformatics.
In the upper grades it can be used for projects on environmental phenomena, where sensor stations are built, programmed and positioned by the students.
Furthermore the sensor stations are connected to the Internet, where the measurements are updated and published on <a href=\"http://www.sensebox.de/en/osem\" class=\"link\">openSenseMap</a>. In this way, data can be shared with other schools, citizens and scientists.</p>

  aboutus:
    header: "About us"
    description: "For a number of years, our team from  the <a class=\"link\" href=\"http://gi-at-school.de\" target=\"_blank\">GI@School</a> Lab at the <a class=\"link\" href=\"http://ifgi.de\" target=\"_blank\">Institute for Geoinformatics</a> has been gathering experience through the organization of workshops with students and teachers. The collection of data with do-it-yourself sensor stations has provided an especially accessible way to work with geographic information and environmental data in this context. Moreover programming skills are taught in a very illustrative and tangible way. This experience led us to develop the senseBox:edu based on a combination of Arduino micro-controller, sensors, and accessories for teams to work in a classroom context. The senseBox:home simplifies this approach as a general Citizen Science Toolkit."

    citizenscience:
      header: "Citizen Science"
      description: "The  <em>senseBox:home</em> is a Citizen Science toolkit. With senseBox you can make measurements, helping to answer a variety of scientific questions and to support Citizen Science Projects from the local to global scale. Data collected by senseBox can increase the measured density of various enviromental factors and can contribute to more precise statements regarding climate, pollution or traffic."
    education:
      header: "Education"
      description: "The <em>senseBox:edu</em> is designed to be a tool for schools in a combination of subjects, whereas interdisciplinary projects in informatics/electronics/physics are build and programmed. The data collected then can be used to applicable research questions, in areas such as geography, biology or chemistry. For example, one application could be the analysis and interpolation of time-series data, which provides also interdisciplinary links to mathematics.</p>
      <p>The senseBox:edu kit is suitable for one to three students. The box contains an Arduino Uno (or Genuino Uno) micro-controller, a variety of sensors, resistors, devices for circuits (among others: LEDs, cables and breadboard) and possibilities to save and transmit collected data. Multiple senseBox:edu (up to 11) can be packed in a single class box. The Arduino micro-controller is the heart of the collection and is used to control the connected components on digital or analogue inputs and outputs."
