text: "<p>With <em>senseBox</em> , citizens and schools are able to collect environmental data using sensors for climate (weather, air quality), transport (traffic density or noise pollution) and many more phenomena to find out more about the environment.</p>

    <p>The data collected may be published as open data on the <a href=\"http://www.sensebox.de/en/osem\" class=\"link\">openSenseMap</a>.</p>

    <p>Citizens with <a href=\"http://www.sensebox.de/en/products\" class=\"link\">senseBox:home</a> can use the technology for their own local research, to collect data by themselves or to contribute to the openSenseMap sensor network.</p>

    <p>Additionally, we created <a href=\"http://www.sensebox.de/en/products\" class=\"link\">senseBox:edu</a> for schools and junior scientists, which is an experimental box with didactical concepts, instructions and project ideas included. </p>
